# infinitelives.pixi

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/infinitelives/infinitelives.pixi.svg)](https://clojars.org/infinitelives/infinitelives.pixi)

A 2D ClojureScript Game Engine. For building webgames. It's not really an engine, it's just a library. Just a bunch of 2D Game functionality that depends apon pixi.js. Pixi.js comes bundled (via cljsjs dependency package).

## Setup

To start a standalone, client-side only game, a good basis is the figwheel template. `lein new figwheel myproj`.

Add the following to the dependencies section of your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
[infinitelives/infinitelives.pixi "0.1.0"]
```

## Initialising a canvas

Near the start of your core.cljs, defonce a canvas like:

```clojure
(:require [infinitelives.pixi.canvas :as c])
```
...
```clojure
(defonce canvas
  (c/init
   {:expand true
    :engine :auto
    :layers [:bg :world :float :ui]
    :background 0x505050
    }))
```

This should set up an autosizing canvas with the layers created and laid out like specified.

## Loading Assets

One approach to start a game-jam game architecture is one entry go-thread that pre-loads all the assets for the game and registers them in the resources atoms.

resources/load-resources initiates the pre loading of assets. It immediately returns a channel. Pull once from the channel to wait for complete fade out of the loading bar.

```clojure
(resources/load-resources
    canvas :ui          ;; which layer I want the loading bar on
    [
      "sfx/bloop.ogg"
      "sfx/bing.ogg"
      "sfx/music.ogg"
      "img/sprites.png"
      "img/backgrounds.png"
      "fonts/arial.woff2"
    ]
    :full-colour 0x807030
    :highlight 0xffff80
    :lowlight 0x303010
    :empty-colour 0x202020
    :debug-delay 0.2
    :width 400
    :height 32
    :fade-in 0.2
    :fade-out 0.5)
```

## Registering Textures or SubTextures

Often, graphics assets are comprised of many individual image frames laid out on a larger `spritesheet`. You can register any region of any loaded image asset as a tagged texture. You specify the tag as a keyword. For example:

```clojure
(:require [infinitelives.pixi.texture :as texture]
	  [infinitelives.pixi.resources :as resources])

(texture/load-sprite-sheet!
  (resources/get-texture :sprites :nearest)   ;; :sprites refers to the filename sprites.png.
                                              ;; as the loader loads them, it registers them
                                              ;; with their filename's base as a keyword.
  {:player-standing {:pos [0 0] :size [16 16]}})
```

You can load many assets by defining an asset data structure:

```clojure
(def sprites-assets
  {:ground-1
   {:pos [0 0]
    :size [32 24]}
   :ground-2
   {:pos [32 0]
    :size [16 16]}
   :grass-1
   {:pos [48 0]
    :size [16 16]}
   :grass-2
   {:pos [64 0]
    :size [16 16]}
   :tree-1
   {:pos [31 56]
    :size [9 16]}
   :tree-2
   {:pos [48 56]
    :size [8 16]}})

(texture/load-sprite-sheet!
  (resource/get-texture :sprites :nearest)
  sprites-assets)
```

## Adding Sprites

Now you can use these registered textures in sprites:

```clojure

(canvas/with-sprite canvas :world    ;; the canvas and layer the sprite should be on
  ;; now name -> sprite binding pairs in a vector
  [ground (sprite/make-sprite
  	    :ground-1
	    :scale 3
	    :xhandle 0.5 :yhandle 0.5
	    :alpha 1.0)
   tree (sprite/make-sprite
   	  :tree-2
	  :x 100 :y 100
	  :y-handle 1.0)]
    ;; inside the scope of the macro, the sprite is on the layer
    ;; apon exit from the scope, the sprite is removed and disappears
    ;; So, loop forever, flipping the frames of the grass and tree
    (loop [frame 0]
      (<! (events/next-frame!))
      (sprite/set-texture! ground (if (> (mod frame 60) 30)
                                    :ground-1 :ground-2))
      (sprite/set-texture! tree (if (> (mod frame 200) 100)
                                    :tree-1 :tree-2))
      (recur (inc frame))))
```

## Pixel Fonts

You can use pixel fonts by rendering all the characters you want to
use into a spritesheet and then building a font from that section with
the `pixel-font` macro.

The path to the sprite sheet is specified as a file path relative
to `resources/public` as the macro analyses the image at compile
time and calculates all the glyph positions. The client side operation
uses this font definition to find it's glyphs.

Create a pixel font with:

```clojure
(pf/pixel-font :big "img/fonts.png" [127 84] [500 128]
               :chars ["ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
                       "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
                       "0123456789!?#`'.,"]
               :kerning {"fo" -2  "ro" -1 "la" -1 }
               :space 5)
```

The font is given the font-name `:big`, and is built from the img/fonts.png
spritesheet from position (127, 84) to position (500, 128). The characters
are laid out as shows in the :chars field. This can either be a single string,
or a vector. This is just to improve readability, allowing you to put line
breaks in the character definitions source. Kerning optionally gives a list
of character pairs that need their distance adjusted. Space is how many pixels
to jump for a space character (or any character not found in the font).

You make text from a font just like a sprite:

```clojure
(c/with-sprite canvas :bg
   [text (pf/make-text :big "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy sequence!"
                       :tint 0xb0c0ff
                       :scale 3
                       :rotation 0)]
   ... code here ...
)
```

## Complete example

Here is the first intro example to pixi.js:

https://pixijs.github.io/examples/index.html?s=basics&f=basic.js&title=Basics

Here is a complete port of the spinning bunny from the intro example to pixi.js for comparison.

```clojure
(ns basic.core
    (:require [infinitelives.pixi.canvas :as c]
              [infinitelives.pixi.events :as e]
              [infinitelives.pixi.resources :as r]
              [infinitelives.pixi.texture :as t]
              [infinitelives.pixi.sprite :as s]
              [cljs.core.async :refer [<!]])
    (:require-macros [cljs.core.async.macros :refer [go]]))

(defonce canvas
  (c/init {:layers [:bg] :background 0x1099bb}))

(defonce main-thread
  (go
    (<! (r/load-resources canvas :bg ["img/bunny.png"]))

    (t/set-texture! :rabbit (r/get-texture :bunny :nearest))

    (c/with-sprite canvas :bg
      [rabbit (s/make-sprite :rabbit)]
      (loop [angle 0]
        (s/set-rotation! rabbit angle)
        (<! (e/next-frame))
        (recur (+ 0.1 angle))))))
```

Compare and contrast the two approaches.

Even with the large namespace declaration, it's about the same length as the pixi.js one. But we also get an asset loader bar, and a csp based system for controlling state that isn't mutatey, unlike the event driven JS version. That is, the angle of the bunny is completely dependent on the value of `angle` within the `loop`/`recur` block, and not dependent in any way on the _existing_ angle of rotation of the sprite.

This example is in the `examples/basic` folder. After installing infinitelives.pixi, go into that directory and issue a `lein figwheel`. Then when the server has started, point your browser at http://localhost:3449/
